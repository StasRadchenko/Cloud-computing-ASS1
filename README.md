# OCR in the Cloud
In this project we have implemneted a real-world application to distributively apply OCR algorithms on images.
we display each image with its recognized text on a webpage.

## Team
We are two students and we implemented the project together.
Our names:

Tal Baum

Stas Radchenko

## Instructions 
There are a few steps we have to follow in order to run the application smoothly.
First ,we have to upload the following zip files to our bucket:

1.manager.zip

2.worker.zip

Now, we need to run this line in the terminal with the names of our input files and the n we chose.
```
java -jar Ass1.jar inputFileName n
```
